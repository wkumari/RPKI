    <abstract>
      <t>When using the RPKI, address space holders need to issue ROA
      object(s) to authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to IP
      prefix(es). This memo discusses operational problems which may arise from
      ROAs containing multiple IP prefixes and recommends that each ROA
      contain a single IP prefix.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), a Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) is a digitally signed object which identifies that a
      single Autonomous System (AS) has been authorized by the address space
      holder to originate routes to one or more prefixes within the address
      space <xref target="RFC6482"/>.</t>

      <t>Each ROA contains an "asID" field and an "ipAddrBlocks" field. The
      "asID" field contains one single AS number which is authorized to
      originate routes to the given IP address prefixes. The "ipAddrBlocks"
      field contains one or more IP address prefixes to which the AS is
      authorized to originate the routes.</t>

      <t>If the address space holder needs to authorize more than one AS to
      advertise the same set of IP prefixes, multiple ROAs must be issued (one
      for each AS number <xref target="RFC6480"/>). Prior to this document,
      there was no guidance for choosing to issue a separate ROA for each IP
      prefix or a single ROA containing multiple IP prefixes.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"/>
      <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all
      capitals, as shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
      <t>An address space holder can issue a separate ROA for each of its
      routing announcements. Alternatively, for a given asID, it can issue a
      single ROA for multiple routing announcements, or even for all of its
      routing announcements. Since a given ROA is either valid or invalid, the
      routing announcements for which that ROA was issued will "share fate"
      when it comes to RPKI validation. Currently, no guidance is offered in
      existing RFCs to recommend what kinds of ROA are issued: one per prefix,
      or one ROA for multiple routing announcements. The problem of
      fate-sharing is not discussed or addressed.</t>

      <t>In the RPKI trust chain, the Certification Authority (CA) certificate
      issued by a parent CA to a delegate of some resources may be replaced by
      the parent at any time resulting in changes to resources specified in the
      <xref target="RFC3779"/> certificate extension. Any ROA object that
      includes resources which are a) no longer contained in the new CA
      certificate, or b) contained in a new CA certificate that is not yet
      discovered by Relying Party (RP) software, will be rejected as invalid.
      Since ROA invalidity affects all routes specified in that ROA, unchanged
      resources with associated routes via that asID cannot be separated from
      those affected by the change in the CA certificate validity. They will
      fall under this invalid ROA even though there was no intention to change
      their validity. Had these resources been in a separate ROA, there would
      have been no change to the issuing CA certificate, and therefore no
      subsequent invalidity.</t>

      <t>CAs should carefully coordinate ROA updates with resource certificate
      updates. This process may be automated if a single entity manages both
      the parent CA and the CA issuing the ROAs (scenario D in [<xref
      target="RFC8211"/> Section 3]). However, in other deployment scenarios,
      this coordination becomes more complex.</t>

      <t>As there is a single expiration time for the entire ROA, expiration
      will affect all prefixes in the ROA. If the ROA is not reissued in a
      timely manner, the whole set of IP prefixes will be affected. Had these
      prefixes been in separately issued ROAs, their validity interval would be
      unique to each ROA, and invalidity would only affected by re-issuance of
      the specific parent CA certificate which issued them.</t>

      <t>A prefix could be allowed to be originated from an AS only for a
      specific period of time, for example if the IP prefix was leased out
      temporarily. This would be more difficult to manage, and potentially be
      more error-prone if a ROA with multiple IP prefixes was used. Similarly
      more complex routing may demand changes in asID or routes for a subset of
      prefixes. Re-issuance of the ROA may cause change to validity for all
      routes in the affected ROA. If the time limited resources are in a
      separate ROA, or for more complex routing if each change in asID or
      routes for a given prefix reflects changes to discrete ROA, then no
      change to validity of unaffected routes will be caused.</t>

      <t>The use of ROA with a single IP prefix can minimize these
      side-effects. It avoids fate-sharing irrespective of the causes, where
      the parent CA issuing each ROA remains valid and where each ROA itself
      remains valid.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Recommendations">
      <t>For normal ROA issuance, it is recommended to include a single IP
      prefix in each ROA, and to issue one ROA for each advertised prefix.</t>

      <t>In some special scenarios, for example where the resource ownership
      and route origin state is stable (e.g., the IP addresses of a DNS root
      server and the related AS number), or a CA has operational problems
      producing increased number of individual ROAs, or if the goal is to
      implement fate-sharing for a set of prefixes as a deliberate policy then
      multiple IP prefixes may be grouped into one ROA.</t>

      <t>Where announced prefixes align and would permit aggregation, but the
      aggregated one is not announced in Border Gateway Protoco (BGP), it is
      not recommended to aggregate multiple announced prefixes into one ROA by
      adjusting prefix length (<xref target="RFC9319"/> Section 5:
      Recommendations about Minimal ROAs and maxLength). Instead, the specific
      announced prefixes should have their own ROA.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Issuing separate ROAs for independent IP prefixes may increase the
      file fetch burden on RP during validation. Then some compression
      algorithm as in <xref target="GSG17" format="default" sectionFormat="of"
      derivedContent="GSG17"/> MAY be adopted to reduce the potential impact on
      the performance of the RPKI ecosystem. </t>
